# Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎮

![Alt text](/src/assets/tie.PNG)


Welcome to the ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe showdown! In this simple-yet-terrifying game, you’ll go head-to-head with a machine powered by the Minimax Algorithm. Spoiler alert: You can’t win. Seriously. The AI knows every move you’ll make before you even think it! But hey, you can still try your luck (or maybe just go for a draw).


## 🚀 How It Works
Human Player (that’s you): Plays with an “X”. You can try your best moves, but don’t get too attached to the idea of winning.
AI Opponent (the Minimax overlord): Plays with an “O” and uses the Minimax algorithm to anticipate all your moves. It’s basically Tic-Tac-Toe’s version of a mind-reader.
The AI will always either win or force a draw. So, if you’re feeling lucky, give it a shot. Just don’t expect to win!


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Vue 3 & TypeScript: Because we wanted to make sure the AI crushes you in style.
Minimax Algorithm: This is the brains behind the operation. Minimax calculates every possible outcome, ensuring it’s completely impossible to outsmart.


## 🎨 Features
Unbeatable AI (unless you have a time machine)
Color-Coded Moves: Blue for you, Orange for the bot! Because even when you lose, you’ll do it in style.
Reset Button: So you can play again and again…and lose again and again!


## 🤔 Why Play?
Because it’s fun to try to beat something that can’t be beaten! And who knows? You might just learn some new moves. Or at least learn humility.
